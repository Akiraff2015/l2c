Learning to Code is a community for self taught developers. Come in and ask questions, support your fellow devs, share great links. 

This is a support group for web developers.

## RULES

### 1. Be supportive.
* Support your fellow developer. We're all here to learn.

### 2. Be polite.
* General swearing is not considered impolite in this group, but swearing **AT** people or telling people they are stupid **IS** impolite.

### 3. Don't post links without contex.
* If you're sharing a link, write the reason WHY you're sharing it. Posts that just share links or other posts without any additional text will be deleted.

### 4. Share data, not opinions.
* We're coders — we share data, not opinions. While your opinion is valued, it may not be the right solution for someone. Please keep this in mind.

### 5. Absolutely no affiliate links.
* Sharing an affiliate link will most likely get you kicked out of this group. Feel free to share links to great courses, but they must not be an affiliate link (a link that makes you money when someone clicks or buys).

### 6. Careful with Udemy links.
* This is not a group for sharing free Udemy courses. There are hundreds of other groups that will do that for you — this is not one of them. If the course is **AMAZING**, we'll keep it. If it's simply promotional, it'll be deleted.

### 7. Ask great question!
* Need help with something? Share what you're working on, share some code if you can, tell us which language you're writing and most importantly: be specific about your problem. A well written question will receive well written answers.
