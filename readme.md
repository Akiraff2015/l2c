# Learning To Code - For Self-Taught Developers

Learning to Code is a community for self taught developers. Come in and ask questions, support your fellow devs, share great links. 

This is a support group for web developers.

RULES:
* Be polite. You can give constructive feedback without being an a-hole.
* When you ask a question, try to use the best grammar and sentence structure you can. People who can't understand your questions can't give you an answer. 
* No discriminatory comments of any kind. Nobody likes that stuff.
* No spam. Posting content unrelated to web development will have you instantly kicked out.
* No affiliate links. Nobody likes those. 
* Do NOT force your opinions on people without data evidence. We're developers, we focus on data, not opinions. But feel free to share your suggestions as long as they stay suggestions.
